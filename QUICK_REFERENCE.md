## Tips

1. **Always keep building harvesters** - More harvesters = more money
2. **Protect your economy** - Enemy will raid your harvesters
3. **Spread out buildings** - Reduces damage from superweapons
4. **Use combined arms** - Mix infantry, tanks, and air units
5. **Scout constantly** - Knowledge is power
6. **Preserve veteran units** - They get bonuses at 3, 7, and 12 kills
7. **Attack enemy harvesters** - Cripple their economy
8. **Build defenses** - Turrets protect your base

## AI Difficulty

- **Easy**: Slow expansion, weak attacks
- **Medium**: Balanced economy and military
- **Hard**: Aggressive expansion, strong combined arms attacks

## Common Mistakes

- ❌ Not building enough power plants
- ❌ Forgetting to build harvesters
- ❌ Attacking with single unit types
- ❌ Ignoring base defenses
- ❌ Not scouting the map
- ✅ Expand, scout, combine units, defend economy!
